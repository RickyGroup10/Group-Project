Meeting 12:00pm 5 September 2022

Katrina, Max and Lissa were present. Apologies from Ricky due to illness.

Notes from discussion board re report 4:
Please notice that Report IV refers to a consolidated EDA (quantitative and qualitative). 
It should include goodness-of-fit tests and hypothesis testing. Which tests you will apply 
depends on what you have gathered from the EDA.
include things like using mahalanobis distances to check group membership, tests of 
equalilty of means and variances, and testing of whether distributions are normal 
(in addition to the graphical analysis that we did for report 3)?
Exactly, but I would not say "in addition". EDA helps us raise interesting hypotheses about 
the process that produced the data. Ideally, you should not "pile" or blindly add results. 
Let EDA speak to you, formulate questions, and answer them with the tools we have seen in the lectures.


Discussion on next steps for our milestone 4 report. Everyone will look at what we did in report 3 and 
find the questions that interest them the most and where we want to go from here. 
We will discuss this tomorrow.

Please put your interesting questions here:
- Does having VIP in different countries affect visits/likes differently
- Do country and age affect visits/likes/count of pictures

Presentation next week. We had a quick discussion regarding our presentation next week. We agreed to meet next 
Monday to discuss this further. Everyone needs to send a photo of themselves for the presentation slides, either
send this via discord or place in github in the presentations folder.
