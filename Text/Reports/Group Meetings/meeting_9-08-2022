Meeting 12pm Tuesday 9 August 2022

- All present at meeting

- All presented at least one data set for discussion. We had suggestions of Gaia data set, 
mental health and technology, dating app statistics, river water quality and more.

- It was decided that we would be using the Dating App User Profiles' stats data set.

-The data set is available on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jmmvutu/dating-app-lovoo-user-profiles?resource=download).
The license to use the data set is available at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

- We decided to use the Lovoo v3 data set as it was something that we found interesting,
is different from prevoius data sets we have all used and we are interested to see what
information we can obtain from the data set.

- The Lovoo v3 data set contains approximately 24 categorical variables and 8 numercial variables, 
as well as some other data such as name, user id, freetext and picture id.

- After a quick look at the data set we note that the gender for all data is female, however
the gender they are looking for is a mixture of male, female, both or none.

- We are interested to see which gender the females are looking for. Whether their age affects
which gender they are looking for. Whether there is any correlation between counts_profileVisits
and counts_kisses and seeing if there are any differences between countries.

- We are sure as we explore the data more we will come up with a lot more questions.

- Next meeting scheduled for 1pm 16/00/22
