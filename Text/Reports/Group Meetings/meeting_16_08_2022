Meeting 12:30pm 16 August 2022

Ricky, Max and Lissa were present. Apologies from Katrina due to illness.

We discussed our data set and pros and cons of some of the varaiables.
We decided that we would like to use age, counts_pictures, counts_ProfileVisits, 
counts_kisses and distance as our five numerical variables. We would like to use
country and isVip as our categorical variables.
We will run this past Katrina to check and ask for her input into the data set.

We will then look at dividing the dataset for each of to work on our EDA.

We will set up an Rmd file for each of us so to be able to upload our EDA and then
compile.

Discussed possibly meeting on Sunday aftenoon to see how everyone is going with
their EDA. Or at least chatting on the discord or looking a facebook messenger chat
for more instant messaging.

It was mentioned that everyone should watch the video on Blackboard regarding github
set-up. There was usefuk information in there for those that have not used github in
terms of how to pull the files to your computer and commit then back to github.
